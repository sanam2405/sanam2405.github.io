                        <p>During the online assessment for the <strong>Software Development Engineer Intern</strong>
                            role at <strong>Razorpay</strong>, I was provided with a timed window
                            to solve three questions. The first two questions were relatively easy and could be solved
                            with regular LeetCode practice, whereas the third question was more challenging. It required
                            solving a maximize the minimum or minimize the maximum kind of problem based on Binary
                            Search On Answer and Graphs. I needed to construct a graph at each iteration of the binary
                            search and check the reachability between two points. This problem turned out to be the
                            deciding factor in the online assessment, and very few candidates were able to pass all the
                            test cases. Although I passed all the test cases using Binary Search, I later learned that
                            Anumoy solved the question using Dijkstra's algorithm. </p>

                        <p> Moving on to the interview, it was conducted on the Google Meet platform, and the
                            interviewer began with a brief introduction, asking me about my name and background before
                            introducing himself. He then proceeded to present me with two DSA problems, which were
                            pasted on a Google Sheet. </p>

                        <p> The first problem was the <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/"><i> Coin
                                    Change 2 </i></a> problem, which is a standard DP problem. I explained
                            my approach to the interviewer, starting with the recursive approach and explaining why my
                            recurrence was working. After that, I coded a recursive solution and then memoized the
                            solution. The interviewer appeared satisfied, and I informed him that I could further create
                            a tabulation DP. However, he was content with the solution and moved on to the second
                            question. </p>

                        <p> The second problem was the <a
                                href="https://leetcode.com/problems/excel-sheet-column-title/"><i> Excel Sheet Column
                                    Title </i></a> problem, which is a LeetCode easy
                            problem. However, I struggled with the question on the spot. I took some time to come up
                            with a pattern, wrote it down, and coded it for the test cases provided by the interviewer.
                            Unfortunately, my solution was not generalizing, and I ran out of time. The interviewer then
                            asked me to come up with whatever I had thought of, and I wrote a general solution (although
                            it was not), which passed all the test cases. I explained to him why my solution should
                            work, and he dry ran the given test cases and some test cases that he had not pasted on the
                            sheet. He appeared satisfied, and he concluded the interview with no parting words. I
                            disconnected, feeling like I had messed up badly. Later, I discovered that my solution to
                            the second question would fail in some corner cases, which my interviewer had missed. </p>

                        <p> To conclude, it is worth noting that I was not asked any questions other than DSA. I found
                            this somewhat surprising, but it is essential to prepare for the topics from DBMS, OOPs and
                            OS as most companies
                            focus on them significantly. It is a relief to report that I was ultimately selected for the
                            SDE Intern role at Razorpay.
                        </p>

                        <h2 id="ansys">My Ansys Interview Experience</h2>

                        <p>
                            I had the opportunity to interview for a <strong>Software Development Engineer
                                Intern</strong> role
                            with <strong>Ansys</strong>. The interview spanned over an hour and a half and was a
                            rigorous technical
                            examination of my skills and knowledge. Here is a detailed account of my interview
                            experience. </p>

                        <p> The interview began with a deep dive into the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm.
                            The interviewer heavily grilled me on topics such as pointers and its types, void pointers,
                            constructors and destructors, calling orders of constructors and destructors, and
                            overloading them. Additionally, I was questioned on class versus object, and asked to dry
                            run a code snippet involving pointers, polymorphism, abstraction, overloading, overriding,
                            data hiding, encapsulation, inheritance and its types. The interviewer also asked me about
                            abstract classes and its need, virtual classes, and operator overloading. It was clear that
                            the interviewer was looking for a comprehensive understanding of OOP concepts, and their
                            application in real-world scenarios. </p>

                        <p> During my preparation for the interview, I found the MySirG YouTube <a
                                href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLYz8uHU480j37APNXBdPz7YzAi4XlQUF"><i>
                                    playlist
                                </i></a> on OOP by
                            Saurabh Sukhla to be incredibly useful. His in-depth explanations and examples provided a
                            solid foundation for my knowledge and understanding of OOP concepts. </p>

                        <p> Moving on from the OOP discussion, the interviewer presented me with three coding questions.
                            The first problem was related to the <a
                                href="https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/"><i> Next Greater
                                    Element</i></a>, which I solved using stacks. The
                            second question involved finding the <a
                                href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/"><i> Longest
                                    Increasing Subsequence</i></a>, which I solved using
                            dynamic programming. Finally, the third question was about <a
                                href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-cycle-undirected-graph/"><i> Detecting Cycles
                                    In An Undirected
                                    Graph</i></a>. These questions were standard however they required a thorough
                            understanding of the
                            underlying data structures and algorithms. I was able to solve all three problems
                            efficiently, which gave me a sense of confidence throughout the rest of the interview. </p>

                        <p> Overall, the interview was highly technical, and focused on testing my problem-solving
                            skills, as well as my knowledge of computer science fundamentals with a very emphasis on
                            OOP.
                            The interviewer asked thoughtful and challenging questions, and I appreciated the
                            opportunity to engage
                            in a meaningful discussion on various topics. The interview experience at Ansys was
                            rigorous, but
                            fair, and provided me with an opportunity to showcase my skills and abilities. </p>

                        <p> In conclusion, my experience with the Ansys interview process was highly rewarding. The
                            interviewer was professional, knowledgeable, and highly skilled, and the questions were
                            challenging and thought-provoking. While the interview was rigorous and demanding, it was
                            also a great opportunity for me to showcase my skills and knowledge. I am happy to share
                            that I was offered a <i>6-month internship</i> at Ansys.
                        </p>
