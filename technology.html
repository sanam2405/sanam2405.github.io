            <h2 id="razorpay">My Razorpay Interview Experience</h2>

            <p>
              During the online assessment for the
              <strong>Software Development Engineer Intern</strong> role at
              <strong>Razorpay</strong>, I was provided with a timed window to
              solve three questions. The first two questions were relatively
              easy and could be solved with regular LeetCode practice, whereas
              the third question was more challenging. It required solving a
              maximize the minimum or minimize the maximum kind of problem
              based on Binary Search On Answer and Graphs. I needed to
              construct a graph at each iteration of the binary search and
              check the reachability between two points. This problem turned
              out to be the deciding factor in the online assessment, and very
              few candidates were able to pass all the test cases. Although I
              passed all the test cases using Binary Search, I later learned
              that Anumoy solved the question using Dijkstra's algorithm.
            </p>

            <p>
              Moving on to the interview, it was conducted on the Google Meet
              platform, and the interviewer began with a brief introduction,
              asking me about my name and background before introducing
              himself. He then proceeded to present me with two DSA problems,
              which were pasted on a Google Sheet.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first problem was the
              <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/"><i> Coin Change 2 </i></a>
              problem, which is a standard DP problem. I explained my approach
              to the interviewer, starting with the recursive approach and
              explaining why my recurrence was working. After that, I coded a
              recursive solution and then memoized the solution. The
              interviewer appeared satisfied, and I informed him that I could
              further create a tabulation DP. However, he was content with the
              solution and moved on to the second question.
            </p>

            <p>
              The second problem was the
              <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/excel-sheet-column-title/"><i> Excel Sheet Column Title </i></a>
              problem, which is a LeetCode easy problem. However, I struggled
              with the question on the spot. I took some time to come up with
              a pattern, wrote it down, and coded it for the test cases
              provided by the interviewer. Unfortunately, my solution was not
              generalizing, and I ran out of time. The interviewer then asked
              me to come up with whatever I had thought of, and I wrote a
              general solution (although it was not), which passed all the
              test cases. I explained to him why my solution should work, and
              he dry ran the given test cases and some test cases that he had
              not pasted on the sheet. He appeared satisfied, and he concluded
              the interview with no parting words. I disconnected, feeling
              like I had messed up badly. Later, I discovered that my solution
              to the second question would fail in some corner cases, which my
              interviewer had missed.
            </p>

            <p>
              To conclude, it is worth noting that I was not asked any
              questions other than DSA. I found this somewhat surprising, but
              it is essential to prepare for the topics from DBMS, OOPs and OS
              as most companies focus on them significantly. It is a relief to
              report that I was ultimately selected for the SDE Intern role at
              Razorpay.

            <h2 id="ansys">My Ansys Interview Experience</h2>

            <p>
              I had the opportunity to interview for a
              <strong>Software Development Engineer Intern</strong> role with
              <strong>Ansys</strong>. The interview spanned over an hour and a
              half and was a rigorous technical examination of my skills and
              knowledge. Here is a detailed account of my interview
              experience.
            </p>

            <p>
              The interview began with a deep dive into the Object-Oriented
              Programming (OOP) paradigm. The interviewer heavily grilled me
              on topics such as pointers and its types, void pointers,
              constructors and destructors, calling orders of constructors and
              destructors, and overloading them. Additionally, I was
              questioned on class versus object, and asked to dry run a code
              snippet involving pointers, polymorphism, abstraction,
              overloading, overriding, data hiding, encapsulation, inheritance
              and its types. The interviewer also asked me about abstract
              classes and its need, virtual classes, and operator overloading.
              It was clear that the interviewer was looking for a
              comprehensive understanding of OOP concepts, and their
              application in real-world scenarios.
            </p>

            <p>
              During my preparation for the interview, I found the MySirG
              YouTube
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLYz8uHU480j37APNXBdPz7YzAi4XlQUF"><i> playlist </i></a>
              on OOP by Saurabh Sukhla to be incredibly useful. His in-depth
              explanations and examples provided a solid foundation for my
              knowledge and understanding of OOP concepts.
            </p>

            <p>
              Moving on from the OOP discussion, the interviewer presented me
              with three coding questions. The first problem was related to
              the
              <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/"><i> Next Greater Element</i></a>, which I
              solved using stacks. The second question involved
              finding the
              <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/"><i> Longest Increasing
                  Subsequence</i></a>, which I solved using dynamic programming. Finally, the third
              question was about
              <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-cycle-undirected-graph/"><i> Detecting Cycles In An
                  Undirected Graph</i></a>. These questions were standard however they required a
              thorough understanding of the underlying data structures and
              algorithms. I was able to solve all three problems efficiently,
              which gave me a sense of confidence throughout the rest of the
              interview.
            </p>

            <p>
              Overall, the interview was highly technical, and focused on
              testing my problem-solving skills, as well as my knowledge of
              computer science fundamentals with a very emphasis on OOP. The
              interviewer asked thoughtful and challenging questions, and I
              appreciated the opportunity to engage in a meaningful discussion
              on various topics. The interview experience at Ansys was
              rigorous, but fair, and provided me with an opportunity to
              showcase my skills and abilities.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, my experience with the Ansys interview process
              was highly rewarding. The interviewer was professional,
              knowledgeable, and highly skilled, and the questions were
              challenging and thought-provoking. While the interview was
              rigorous and demanding, it was also a great opportunity for me
              to showcase my skills and knowledge. I am happy to share that I
              was offered a <i>6-month internship</i> at Ansys.

              "The work at DRDO is confidential however, I have tried to give
              a brief overview of the technology and work I have done there."
            </blockquote>

            <p>
              During my internship at <i><strong> DRDO </strong></i>, I had
              the opportunity to work on <i> web servers </i> and gain
              valuable knowledge about the technology. A
              <i> web server </i> is a program that processes network requests
              and serves users with files that create web pages, using
              <i> Hypertext Transfer Protocol </i> (HTTP). It stores
              <i> HTTP </i> files, including HTML documents, images, CSS
              stylesheets, and JavaScript files, which are delivered to
              clients upon request.
            </p>

            <p>
              On the hardware side, a <i> web server </i> is a computer that
              stores <i> web server software </i> and website component files.
              It connects to the Internet and supports physical data
              interchange with other devices connected to the web. On the
              software side, a <i> web server </i> includes several parts that
              control how web users access hosted files. At a minimum, it
              includes an <i> HTTP server</i>, which understands URLs and
              <i> HTTP </i>, and can be accessed through the domain names of
              the websites it stores, delivering the content of these hosted
              websites to the end user's device.
            </p>

            <p>
              Whenever a browser needs a file that is hosted on a
              <i> web server </i>, the browser requests the file via
              <i> HTTP </i>. The (software) <i> HTTP server</i> accepts the
              request, finds the requested document, and sends it back to the
              browser through <i> HTTP </i>.
              <i> Hypertext Transfer Protocol </i> (HTTP) is an
              application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia
              documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication
              between web browsers and <i> web servers </i>, but it can also
              be used for other purposes. <i> HTTP </i> follows a classical
              client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make
              a request, then waiting until it receives a response.
            </p>

            <p>
              <i> HTTPS </i>, which is the secure version of <i> HTTP</i>,
              encrypts data to increase the security of data transfer. This is
              particularly important when users transmit sensitive data, such
              as when logging into a bank account, email service, or health
              insurance provider.
            </p>

            <p>
              During my training, I studied two <i> web servers </i> in
              particular: <i> Apache Web Server (XAMPP) </i> and
              <i> Nginx Web Server </i>. Both of them have their advantages
              and disadvantages. I worked on <i> XAMPP </i>, a free and
              open-source cross-platform <i> web server </i> solution stack
              package developed by <i> Apache Friends </i>, consisting mainly
              of the <i> Apache HTTP Server </i>, <i> MariaDB </i> database,
              and interpreters for scripts written in the <i> PHP </i> and
              <i> Perl programming languages </i>.
            </p>

            <p>
              For <i> Nginx </i>, the <i> web servers </i> was used directly
              without the need for any third-party addons or software. Both of
              the <i> web servers </i> were installed and mounted on my local
              system and tested to gain a better understanding of their
              functions and performance.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now I present a detailed workflow for parsing <i> Apache </i>and
              <i> Nginx </i> configuration files using <i> Python </i>. The
              aim of the process was to extract important information and
              fields from the configuration files. The workflow consisted of
              the following steps.
            </p>

            <p>
              Setting up the <i> web servers - </i> First, <i> XAMPP </i> was
              installed, and a <i> web server </i> was set up on my local
              machine. A sample dummy webpage was hosted to test the server's
              functionality.
            </p>

            <p>
              Studying the <i> Apache Configuration File - </i>

              To begin the parsing process, the file structure of the
              <i> Apache Web Server </i> was studied in depth. I focused on
              the structure and syntax of the Apache configuration file, which
              is the <i> httpd.conf </i>
              file. I observed the file in detail and noted its location in my
              machine, which is
              <i> /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/etc </i>
            </p>

            <p>
              Parsing <i> Apache Configuration File </i> using
              <i> Python - </i> The information was extracted using a method
              called parsing using the <i> Python </i> programming language. I
              chose to use <i> Python </i> due to its rich availability of
              libraries. The parser that was used for parsing
              <i> httpd.conf </i> is
              <i><a href="https://github.com/etingof/apacheconfig" target="_blank">
                  apacheconfig
                </a></i>.
            </p>

            <p>
              I parsed several important fields such as the
              <i> version </i> of the <i> web server </i>,
              <i> listening ports</i>, <i> user and group </i>,
              <i> server name</i>, <i> error log directory</i>,
              <i> log levels</i>, <i> log format </i>,
              <i> custom log configuration </i>, other <i> alias webpath </i>,
              and <i> access control </i> of the httpd.conf file. This process
              allowed me to extract crucial information that provided me with
              insight into the setup and status of the web server.
            </p>

            <p>
              Studying the <i> Nginx Configuration File - </i> Next, I
              attempted to extract similar fields from the
              <i> Nginx Web Server</i>. To do this, I hosted a dummy website
              using <i> Nginx Web Server</i>. I studied the file structure of
              the <i> Nginx Web Server </i> and specifically the syntax of the
              Nginx configuration file, which is the nginx.conf file. I noted
              its location in my machine, which was
              <i> /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</i>
            </p>

            <p>
              Parsing <i> Nginx Configuration File </i>using
              <i> Python - </i> Similar techniques of Parsing using the
              <i> Python </i> programming language were used to extract fields
              such as the <i> conf file name</i>, <i> user</i>,
              <i> error logs</i>, <i> PID</i>, <i> worker connections</i>,
              <i> listening ports</i>, <i> server name</i>, <i> location</i>,
              <i> error page</i>, and <i> access control</i> of the
              <i> nginx.conf</i> file. The parser that was used for parsing
              <i> nginx.conf</i> is
              <i><a href="https://github.com/nginxinc/crossplane" target="blank">
                  crossplane</a></i>.
            </p>

            <p>
              <i><a href="https://github.com/sanam2405/WebServersConfParsing" target="_blank">Github Link</a></i>
              to all the source code.
            </p>

            <p>
              All of these important fields were printed in the terminal.
              However, a better modification of this could have been to write
              the parsed results in a file using File Handling in
              <i> Python</i>. In conclusion, parsing configuration files of
              <i> web servers </i> such as <i> Apache</i> and
              <i> Nginx </i> using <i> Python</i> can be a valuable tool for
              gathering important information about the web server's set-up
              and status. The workflow for parsing the configuration files
              includes setting up the web server, studying the configuration
              file, and parsing it using the <i> Python </i> programming
              language. By following this workflow, fields such as the version
              of the web server, listening ports, user and group, server name,
              error log directory, and more can be extracted. The parsers used
              for parsing the configuration files are
              <i> apacheconfig </i> and <i> crossplane </i>, and the parsed
              results can be printed in the terminal or written to a file
              using file handling in Python. Overall, this workflow provides a
              useful method for obtaining valuable information about
              <i> web servers </i> and their configurations.

            <h2 id="cu">My CU Internship Experience</h2>

            <p>
              During my summer internship at <strong><i> Calcutta University </i></strong>, I had the opportunity to
              work on a project that
              involved using micro-controllers to collect and analyze water data. The project required a good
              understanding of various technologies such as NodeMCU, Arduino, Ultrasonic Depth Sensor, and ARIMA
              time-series model. In this article, I will discuss my experience working on this project and provide
              insights on the different aspects of the project. </p>

            <p> NodeMCU is a microcontroller that is based on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. It has 11 digital input/output
              pins and one analog input pin. The NodeMCU operates at 3.3V and can be powered via a micro-USB port. It
              also has Wi-Fi connectivity, which makes it easy to connect to the internet and send data to a cloud
              platform. During my internship, I learned about the various pins present in NodeMCU and how to use them
              for different purposes. </p>

            <p> Synchronization of NodeMCU with ArduinoIDE was also a crucial part of the project. The ArduinoIDE is an
              open-source software that is used to program microcontrollers such as Arduino and NodeMCU. It provides an
              easy-to-use interface to write, upload, and debug code. Synchronizing NodeMCU with ArduinoIDE required
              installing the NodeMCU board package in ArduinoIDE and selecting the correct board and port settings. </p>

            <p>Another key aspect of the project was the synchronization of NodeMCU with Ultrasonic Depth Sensor. The
              Ultrasonic Depth Sensor is a device that is used to measure the distance of an object by sending and
              receiving ultrasonic waves. It is commonly used in robotics and automation. Synchronizing NodeMCU with
              Ultrasonic Depth Sensor required connecting the sensor to NodeMCU and writing the appropriate code to read
              and process the sensor data. </p>

            <p> The project also involved comparing ESP-32 and NodeMCU. ESP-32 is another microcontroller that is
              similar
              to NodeMCU but has more advanced features such as Bluetooth and dual-core processing. The comparison
              helped me understand the pros and cons of each microcontroller and choose the appropriate one for the
              project. </p>

            <p> Synchronization of NodeMCUs was also an important part of the project as it allowed to communicate
              between
              multiple microcontrollers. Identifying the MAC address of NodeMCU was crucial for synchronizing multiple
              NodeMCUs. The MAC address is a unique identifier that is assigned to the Wi-Fi module of NodeMCU. It is
              used to identify the device on a network. </p>

            <p> Two-way communication between NodeMCUs was another key feature of the project. It allowed to send and
              receive data between two NodeMCUs. Many-to-one communication between NodeMCUs was also important as it
              allowed me to send data from multiple NodeMCUs to a single NodeMCU. One-to-one communication of NodeMCUs
              was also important as it allowed me to send data between two NodeMCUs without interference from other
              devices on the network. </p>

            <p></p> Multicasting multiple NodeMCUs to a single NodeMCU was another feature of the project. It allowed me
            to
            send data from multiple NodeMCUs to a single NodeMCU at the same time. This was useful in situations where
            I needed to collect data from multiple sources and send it to a single location for analysis.

            <p> I also connected HC-SRO4 with NodeMCU and established one-to-one communication. HC-SRO4 is an Ultrasonic
              Sensor that is commonly used in robotics and automation. I wrote the appropriate code to read and process
              the sensor data and send it to the cloud platform for analysis. </p>

            <p></p> Connecting the HC-SRO4 with NodeMCU and multicasting was also a part of the project. This allowed me
            to
            send data from multiple HC-SRO4 sensors to a single NodeMCU at the same time. This was useful in
            situations where I needed to collect data from multiple sensors and multicast it to a single NodeMCU.

            <p> Another important aspect of my internship was learning about the different communication protocols used
              by
              the NodeMCU. One-to-one communication involves connecting two NodeMCUs through a common network and
              exchanging data between them. Many-to-one communication involves connecting multiple NodeMCUs to a single
              NodeMCU to receive and send data. Lastly, multicasting involves sending data from multiple NodeMCUs to a
              single NodeMCU. Through these various communication protocols, I gained an understanding of how data can
              be efficiently transmitted and exchanged between different microcontrollers. </p>

            <p> During the later part of my internship, I worked on integrating the HC-SRO4 sensor with the NodeMCU to
              send data to the ThingSpeak platform. The HC-SRO4 is an ultrasonic depth sensor that is commonly used to
              measure distances in water tanks. By connecting this sensor to the NodeMCU, I was able to collect
              real-time data on water levels in the tank. This data was then sent to the ThingSpeak platform where it
              was analyzed and displayed visually for better understanding. </p>

            <p> Furthermore, I also worked on developing a code for detecting leakage in a water tank using the HC-SRO4
              sensor and water flow sensor. The water flow sensor detects the flow rate of water through a pipe, and by
              comparing it with the water level data collected by the HC-SRO4 sensor, any sudden drop in water levels
              due to leakage could be detected. This code was tested and proved to be highly accurate in detecting any
              potential leaks in the tank. </p>

            <p> Towards the end of my internship, I worked on developing a future forecasting model using the ARIMA
              time-series model. ARIMA is a statistical model used to analyze and forecast time-series data. By using
              this model, I was able to predict the future consumption of water based on the historical data collected
              by the NodeMCU and the HC-SRO4 sensor. This forecasting model was considerably accurate and proved to be
              extremely useful in predicting the future demand for water in the tank. </p>

            <p> Overall, my summer internship at Calcutta University provided me with invaluable hands-on experience in
              working with microcontrollers and sensors, as well as data analysis and forecasting models. I gained a
              deep understanding of the various technologies used in the field of IoT and their practical applications
              in real-world scenarios. Through this internship, I was able to sharpen my technical skills and also
              learned the importance of teamwork and collaboration in achieving common goals. The knowledge and skills I
              gained during this internship will undoubtedly be useful in my future career as a professional in the
              field of IoT and Software Development in general.</p>

            <h2 id="fifa">Experience the Realism of Football Like Never Before: The Technical Wizardry of FIFA 23's
              HyperMotion2</h2>

            <p>

            <h3> Introduction: </h3>

            <p> <strong> FIFA 23 </strong>, the latest release in EA Sports' popular football video game franchise,
              features a new
              gameplay
              system called <i><strong> "HyperMotion2"</strong></i>, which uses machine learning algorithms to create
              over
              6,000 in-game
              animations. Additionally, the game's <i><strong> "Technical Dribbling" </strong></i> system uses the
              <i><strong> "Active Touch" </strong></i> system to
              improve players' dribbling and turning with more responsiveness. This article provides an in-depth
              technical analysis of the machine learning algorithms behind <i>HyperMotion2</i> and the techniques used
              to
              incorporate the animations into the game.
            </p>

            <h3> HyperMotion2 and Machine Learning: </h3>

            <p> The <i>HyperMotion2</i> system captures data from real-life football matches using advanced machine
              learning
              algorithms. The machine learning algorithms analyze the data and identify patterns, allowing the system to
              create realistic in-game animations that accurately replicate the movements of real-life players. </p>

            <p> The machine learning algorithms used in <i>HyperMotion2</i> are based on <i><strong> deep learning
                  neural networks </strong></i>, which are
              designed to simulate the behavior of the human brain. These neural networks consist of layers of
              interconnected nodes that process and analyze data, allowing the system to identify patterns and make
              predictions based on past experience. </p>

            <p> To train the machine learning algorithms used in <i>HyperMotion2</i>, EA Sports used a large dataset of
              football
              matches captured with advanced motion-capture technology. The dataset includes thousands of hours of
              footage, which was carefully analyzed and labeled by a team of experts to ensure the accuracy of the data.
            </p>

            <p> A technique called <i><strong> backpropagation </strong></i> was used by EA Sports.
              Backpropagation is a technique used to adjust the parameters of a neural network to minimize the
              difference
              between the network's predictions and the actual output. In the case of <i>HyperMotion2</i>,
              backpropagation is
              used to adjust the parameters of the neural network to ensure that the in-game animations accurately
              replicate the movements of real-life players.</p>


            <p> The machine learning algorithms used in <i>HyperMotion2</i> are able to identify patterns in the data
              and use
              these patterns to create new animations that accurately replicate the movements of real-life players. The
              system is able to generate over 6,000 unique animations, each with its own set of variables and parameters
              that determine how the animation will be executed in-game.</p>

            <h3> Incorporating Animations into the Game: </h3>

            <p> To incorporate the animations created by the <i>HyperMotion2</i> system into the game, EA Sports used a
              combination of motion-capture technology and traditional animation techniques. The motion-capture
              technology was used to capture the movements of real-life players, while traditional animation techniques
              were used to refine and enhance the animations. </p>

            <p> The motion-capture technology used by EA Sports is one of the most advanced in the industry. It
              involves
              placing sensors on the bodies of real-life players and capturing their movements in real-time. The data
              captured by the sensors is then fed into the machine learning algorithms used by <i>HyperMotion2</i>,
              which use
              this data to create new animations that accurately replicate the movements of the players. </p>

            <p> Once the animations have been created by the machine learning algorithms, they are refined and enhanced
              using traditional animation techniques. This involves adjusting the timing, spacing, and other parameters
              of the animations to ensure they look as realistic as possible. </p>


            <h3>Feautures of HyperMotion2</h3>

            <p>

              <i><strong> Technical Dribbling </strong></i> is a brand new dribbling system that allows attackers to
              calculate their path to the
              ball more intelligently. Animation transitions are informed by machine learning between every dribble
              touch, delivering next-gen visuals and variety with the ball at your feet.
            </p>

            <p> <i><strong> The ML-Jockey system </strong></i> uses machine learning technology to learn from real-world
              defensive situations and
              movement taken from advanced 11v11 match capture data to rewrite the jockeying system in FIFA 23, creating
              more natural animations as defenders face up to oncoming attackers. </p>

            <p> <i><strong> AcceleRATE </strong></i> provides a new layer of personality to how players reach their top
              speed in FIFA 23. From
              explosive acceleration off the mark to more controlled or lengthy changes of pace, players will now reach
              their top speed at different rates to create more variety in player movement and gameplay. </p>

            <p> <i><strong> Composed Ball Striking </strong></i> is a new feature that allows for more natural
              transition between controlling the
              ball and shooting. Combining precision and fluidity, longer high-quality animation creates one continuous
              motion as players trap the ball, rotate, and strike the ball towards the target. </p>

            <p> <i><strong> Kinetic Goalkeeper vs Header Battles </strong></i> is an evolution in two-player interaction
              technology
              that syncs player animations as goalkeepers rise to meet crosses against opposing attacking players,
              creating cleaner outcomes as keepers claim aerial balls.
            </p>

            <h3> Epilogue: </h3>

            <p> <i>HyperMotion2</i> is a groundbreaking system that uses advanced machine learning algorithms to
              create over 6,000 in-game animations that accurately replicate the movements of real-life football
              players. The system is based on deep learning neural networks, which analyze data from real-life football
              matches to identify patterns and create new animations.

              Overall, the <i>HyperMotion2</i> system represents a major step forward in the development of football
              video
              games, and is likely to set a new standard for realism and immersion in the genre.
